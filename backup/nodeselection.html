    <p>This DNS HOWTO assumes you have Googled the basic setup of your BIND 
	service and master/slave deployment. We will only focus on the 3GPP aspect 
	of the zone file and how you can use it with an ASR5000. The 
	<a href="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29303.htm" rel="nofollow">
	3GPP specification 29.303</a> Annex A4.3(S10) Annex 4.11(S11 and S5),

            <h1>Basic DNS Syntax</h1>
        </header>
<p>	Below we show the basic header of a zone file and what each element is and how to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the beginning you will see an <tt>$ORIGIN</tt> <tt>epc.mnc111.mcc222.3gppnetwork.org.</tt>
value. Every record in the zone file that does not end with a dot will automatically inherit the 
<tt>$ORIGIN</tt> value. For example the record <tt>foobar</tt> does not contain a trailing dot so the BIND 
service would read it as <tt>foobar.epc.mnc111.mcc222.3gppnetwork.org</tt>. On the other hand if the 
record was <tt>foobar.</tt>, BIND would read this as <tt>foobar</tt> and nothing else.<br><br>
<div>$ORIGIN epc.mnc111.mcc222.3gppnetwork.org.</div>

</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now the next item in the top of your zone file will be the TTL field. The TTL is sent to the DNS
client of the ASR5000 to let it know when the data expires and it need to do a new DNS query. Please
note this TTL value can be overwritten locally on the ASR5000 via the TTL command in the DNS client
configuration section.<br><br>
<div>$TTL    1800</div></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For the <a href="http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/soa.html" rel="nofollow">Start of Authority(SOA)</a>,
you can refer to the zone file snippet used for EPC below. Note that the email in dot form <tt>root</tt> is
just the root user for the system and will likely be different for your deployment.<br><br> 
<div>	@       IN      SOA     ns      root (  <br>
                                1       ; Serial <br>

                                3600    ; Expire <br>
                                600 )   ; Negative Cache TTL</div></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPTR_record" rel="nofollow">Name Authority Pointer (NAPTR)</a> for 
us will only use two flag types (a &amp; s) which is also called S-NAPTR or Straightforward-NAPTR. In S-NAPTR
you will see many service types which are all defined in 23.003 section 19.4.3 "Service and Protocol service
 names for 3GPP". The first number in the S-NAPTR RR after the word NAPTR is Order and the second number is
 Preference. Also note the existence of application service of "x-3gpp-sgw" &amp; "x-3gpp-pgw" with their
 corresponding application protocol of "x-s5-gtp". These service represents if its a SGW or PGW while the
 S5 protocol means both node types support GTP based S5 and not PMIP. Note that since we have NAPTR with
 flag type "s" for our TAI resolution and gw-selection is co-location, we will not use order or preference
 in selection criteria unless we have multiple best matches in which case lowest order value will trump. <br><br>

followed by port number. Note that when we have multiple best matches with equal order values in
 the NAPTR results then we can use priority to tie break (lower better) and weight in the SRV
 record to balance traffic if priorities were equal(more to add once R14 is released). <br><br>

            <h1>Basic MME Configuration (co-location)</h1>
        </header>
<p>	Below you will find basic MME configuration to support node selection plus 
static selection in the event DNS/BIND is down or unreachable. The top element 
in the structure is the <code>lte-policy/subscriber-map</code> which calls the 
<code>operator-policy</code>. Then the <code>operator-policy</code> calls the 
<code>call-control-profile</code> and <code>apn-profile</code>. The <code>call-control-profile</code>
below is used to say "use dns look up for both SGW and PGW selection" and 
if DNS is down use static list <code>TMD1</code>. The static tai management DB 
is also used to define TA Lists that are sent to UE to inform it about the 
TA is can move between before it needs to perform a TAU. The important part 
in the <code>call-control-profile</code> for node selection is the use of 
<code>gw-selection</code> <code>co-location</code> which tells the MME to use best 
match of SGW and PGW and longest conical name match. In the example above 
we would match conical names up to the nodeName# portion of the FQDN. 
The <code>apn-profile</code> is used for static PGW assignment for when DNS is unreachable.</p>
Please note that if the DNS client gets multiple answers with equal order or 
preference and we have <code>round-robin-answers</code> enabled in the client, 
we will round robin across the results on a per service/PCS2 basis. This may 
result in what looks broken functionality as the first results may get used 
always until all session managers have done so and move on to next result. <br><br>

            <h1>Gateway Selection Logic</h1>
        </header>
<p>Below we detail the co-location gateway selection criteria available in IOS-M R12.2.</p>
<tt>gw-selection co-location</tt>
<ul>
<li><b>co-location</b>
<ul>
<li>co-location as the determining factor for gateway selection. What this means is the MME 
will take all records received from DNS and pair together all SGW and PGW with exact conical 
name match. If failures happen in the pairs, they will be black listed on a per subscriber 
basis during a attach procedure. Once all the pairs are exhausted from failures during a 
single attach procedure, the MME will start using all left records as random pairs until 
success is reached or you run into the four fall back limit mentioned below.</li>
<li>P/SGW retries configured in egtp service</li>
<li>P/SGW fall back happens four times per subscriber to the selected nodes equaling 
total of 5 nodes pair attempts before reject (we only have four co-located pairs in 
the example).</li>
<li>If order and priority are all equal and round robin is configured, the MME will 
use a list for each session manager per PSC card as follows 1,2,3,4,5 to each card 
for its first sub. Then 2,3,4,5,1 for all PSC cards for it next subscriber and so 
one as will round robins through the results.</li><li>	PGW selection uses Order/Priority 
on PGW only when more than one PGW is available and only one SGW is available.</li>
</ul></li>
